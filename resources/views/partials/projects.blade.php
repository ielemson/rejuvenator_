                                        This conference prototype orientation and mentoring program targets secondary school graduates, students, undergraduates, job seekers, and unemployed graduates. Through this initiative, we guide, plan, and harness the visions of our beneficiaries using technology and modern information dissemination methods. We organize workshops, trainings, and impact-driven programs to steer young people towards their educational goals. For those not pursuing higher education, we equip them with vocational skills to become valuable members of society. To date, we have impacted over 780 youths and reached out to 23 schools and youth organizations.

                                        This interactive program for teenagers addresses the relationship between love and self-development. It aims to expose teenagers in secondary schools to the proper meaning of love, helping them avoid emotional distractions that can hinder the pursuit of their life dreams.
